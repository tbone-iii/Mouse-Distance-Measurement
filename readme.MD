<h1> Pixel measurement </h1>

Measures out the distance in pixels between multiple points clicked on by the mouse.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The original intent of this program was to determine the ratio between two distances on an image.
For example, if one wanted to determine how much taller a tree is than another tree is in an image, this program makes it very easy to do so (as opposed to jumping into a heavy-weight image editor and computing by hand).


<h2>Control and Usage</h2>
The method of control is to press and hold a specified hotkey (default: <b>Shift</b>), and while it is pressed,
click between points on the screen to add the points to a list.
Once the hotkey is released, the total distance between the recorded points is calculated.

The ratio between the two most recent distances measured is provided.

Breaking out of the program is specified by an escape key (default: <b>Esc</b>).

The recommended technique to measure distances/ratios is take a screen capture of an image.
